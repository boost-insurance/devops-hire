# Challenge 2
This is to see how you make changes to make challenge 1 better :) by using community modules.

### Require
So in this challenge you will do the following:
- Expand on Challenge 1 in the following
  - Replace all handwritten terraform with opensource gruntworks modules
  - Make sure that using community modules, as we shouldn't reinvent the wheel
  - Move to The Least Privilege practices
  - IAM user for the person running the account
- Create directory taking all the AWS things and migrate them to GCP.
  - Remember we aren't reinventing the wheel, so community modules are ok
- Automate Terraform/Terragrunt plans and applies. We shouldn't be doing anything by hand

- If you use nothing but terragrunt + github actions - 5 points
- If you use self deployed atlantis tooling - 5 points
- If you use Makefiles then - 5 points
